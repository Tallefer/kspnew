    <tr>
      <td>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R3.1</h2>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Track marks</span><br>
KSP tracks all media files' in library statistics and determines marks
based on gathered data. Each track can have up to 5 stars based on how
often it is being played in comparison to other files in library<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Code cleanups</span><br>
Unused units, variables and so on are removed.<br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R3</h2>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic playlists</span><br>
To enable this feature right click on your playlist and then choose
VDJ-&gt;Enable. Ensure that this setting is checked and you are not in
offline mode (it requires internet connection). Now start playing some
track. KSP will automatically download from Last.fm data that will
allow it to establish if you have any other tracks similar to current
one. If you do then they will be added to the playlist.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Equalizer</span><br>
From now on you have an access to Equalizer (currently only KSP for
Windows compilations). Select setting you desire from Equalizer menu or
simply choose it yourself. To enable equalizer go to
Setup-&gt;KSP-&gt;System-&gt;Use Equalizer.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved database</span><br>
Recet changes allowed us to make multithreaded access to database more
stable. Also a few database support bugs have been eliminated.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">No MySQL support</span><br>
From now KSP supports only Sqlite databases.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrics</span><br>
If you are playing track that is in your Media Library you can link
your own lyrics to it. Just go to Currently Played tab and paste your
lyrics there. When you are done click Save Lyrics button. Next time you
play this track your lyrics will load automatically.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple selection (playlist)</span><br>
From now you can select multiple playlist entries for example in order
to delete them<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Offline mode</span><br>
If your network connection is poor or simply doesn't exist then you can
enable an offline mode. Note that if on your playlist you have some
network streams KSP still will be able to play them. Also internal web
browser will work although when you click on link to netowrk stream
playlist (such as those from icecast.org) KSP won't open it. Also
dynamic playlists won't work. Offline mode is not saved on exit which
means that next time you start KSP you still will have to enable it
manually again if you want to stay in offline mode.<br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R2.2</h2>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed "m3u" Playlist Buffer
Overflow</span><br>
It could happen that some playlists could not be properly handled and
that lead to application (and sometimes system) crash. It is rare
situation and considers only specially prepared playlists with long
strings in it. Now KSP by default processes only items with at most 260
characters in file name<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed MediaLibProgress bug
(always hidden)</span><br>
Due to problems with Linux version this progress bar was always hidden
even if rescanning media library. Now this progress bar is handled
different way which increases stability of Linux compilations<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">libbass.so is loaded from
/usr/share/KSP (Linux)</span><br>
Currently all non user specific data is loaded from /usr/share/KSP
excluding libqt4intf.so<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agent string changed</span><br>
Currently builtin webbrwser uses following strings:<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KSP/&lt;version&gt;
(compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)</span> - Windows<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KSP/&lt;version&gt; (X11; Linux
x86_64; U; pl, en_US) </span>- Linux<br>
where version is the version number of KSP (for example 0.2.200.150).<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving playlists as bookmarks
fixed (Linux)</span><br>
Playlists where saved in the wrong files. It was working well but still
now it looks more tidy and clean<br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R2.1</h2>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux compilation possible (as
2009 R3 alpha)</span><br>
Since upcoming R3 release will have also Linux version we have ensured
that KSP even now works with Linux. Currently Linux port is still in
development but it generally works despite it's stability is lower than
Windows version. However current trunk allows Linux compilation.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Indy components instead of
WinInet unit</span><br>
Indy is replacing previously used WinInet based routines.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed getting meta from
Icecast/Shoutcast servers</span><br>
Now whenever meta data is received from server title of currently
played track is extracted, file name label is updated and notification
is shown according to notification settings.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed saving empty tags to KPL
playlists</span><br>
If playlist item has no tag then it can contain random data as tag.
That data is no longer saved to playlist.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plugins loading changed (now
more info in logs)</span><br>
If for some reason plugins is found but cannot be loaded then
information with error code is available in logs.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Added option to store absolute
paths in playlists (by default disabled)</span><br>
Sometimes it happens (Linux compilations) that relative paths cannot be
generated so playlists are saved incorrectly. Now it is possible to use
absolute paths instead.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Added Tell A Friend menu item</span><br>
If you like KSP then you can easily let your friends know about KSP
with only a few clicks.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Added Report Bug menu item</span><br>
If you have found a bug or you want to request new feature then you can
easily do that with Bug report button.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Main web browser object has now
progress bar</span><br>
Main web browser has now the same progress bar as internet media
browser. It works the same way and looks the same way.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Media Library tweaks</span><br>
Several Media Library bugs have been fixed such as not removing non
existing or incorrect items from it.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Like" Media library search</span><br>
Go to Library and there you have new edit field. Put there part of the
file name you want to find in the Media Library and then press Find
Song Like button. Currently it supports finding songs only by file name.<br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R2 (29 August 2009)<br>
      </h2>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plugins configuration</span><br>
KSP allows user to: load/unload, disable/enable chosen and all plugins
at runtime. Note that plugins may require additional libraries to work
properly (and load). KSP at the moment doesn't support checking if
plugin was really loaded.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Log cleaning</span><br>
From now on all logs older than 7 days are to be automatically removed
at startup. If you wish to save some of them then you have to do that
manually<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Main web view buttons</span><br>
Main KSP web browser control has now it's buttons (forward, enter
address, back and so on)<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Crash report window</span><br>
Whnever some exception has been handled window with full crash report
will popup. There user is able to review all logs of current KSP
session and save report to the desktop for further investigation by
developers.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception handling improved</span><br>
Now log will contain also exception message.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Options in one place</span><br>
All options (notification, KSP, Media Library) are now in Setup<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Internet Media browser and
images updates</span><br>
IM browser got 3 new buttons: back, forward and reload. Also you can
easily access your bookmarks by clicking on the star in the main menu.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bookmarks</span><br>
Bookmarks are supported. You can bookmark following items: currently
played track, selected track, whole current playlist.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Switched to QT. Required version
is QT 4.5 (tested with 4.5.2)</span><br>
To obtain the newest QT version go to http://www.qtsoftware.com/.
Remember that KSP requires QT 4.5.x. All other QT versions ARE NOT
supported. Note than each build contains proper libraries so you don't
have to download over 300 mb archive from http://www.qtsoftware.com/.
All you require is installed with KSP. If you are building KSP from
source then you may want to download latest SVN build as well.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">WebKit is being used for Icecast
browsing, Icecast support (no XSPF playlists support yet)</span><br>
Go to Library-&gt;Internet Media to use builtin web browser based on QT
Webkit. Whenever link you click leads to PLS or M3U playlist KSP will
handle it and load replacing currently loaded playlist.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Simple notifications on playlist
end and playfile</span><br>
When new file is played or playlist end is reached simple notification
is displayed. At the moment it is in development so all configuration
can be made only by editing setup.opt file. Find section [Alerts] in
setup.opt file and put there:<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OnNewSongPlayed=1</span><br>
to enable alerts<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OnNewSongPlayed=0</span> <br>
to disable them<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MySQL support is only optional,
support for Sqlite3 added</span><br>
Sqlite3 is now the default database format.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manual folders scan and database
setup dialog buttons added</span><br>
Go to Library-&gt;Setup and press Force Rescan button to scan folders
again. Note that scanning proces might take a while. In
Library-&gt;Setup there is also Setup Database button. KSP now supports
both Sqlite3 and MySQL databases. By default KSP uses Sqlite3 database
that doesn't require configuration. Although if you want to use MySQL
then use that button to configure connection to database server.<br>
